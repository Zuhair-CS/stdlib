# Recipes

> Bite-sized, actionable examples of how to use specific stdlib features.

Welcome to stdlib recipes!

To help you accomplish specific tasks using stdlib, we've authored a number of guided examples which are laser-focused on achieving specific goals. These guides are in contrast to more extensive how-to guides and tutorials, which aim to provide more expansive guidance to accomplish larger tasks and to promote learning, respectively.

If you have specific recipes that you'd like to see or that you'd like to contribute, please feel free to open a discussion on our [issue tracker][stdlib-issue-tracker].
